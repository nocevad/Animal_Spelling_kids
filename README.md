Animal_Spelling_kids

A simple, kid-friendly browser game that helps children learn **letters and animal spelling** using **pictures and interactive buttons**. Created it to get my daughter into computers and practice her spelling. She is nearly 4 years old. She had a little trouble managing the mouse but overall she played it for almost an hour. Considering it only took an half hour to create, seemed like a good deal. 

Add additional animals/images starting at like 89 in 'const animals'. 

Built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no installs. 

 --Why Live Server Is Used --

Live Server runs the project as a small local web server, which allows the browser to safely load images and files using JavaScript. Browsers restrict file access when opening HTML directly (`file:///`), so a local server is required for dynamic behavior. Download extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.

How the Game Works

1. An **animal picture** is shown
2. The animal’s name appears as **blank letters**
3. Kids **click letters** to spell the animal
4. Correct letters fill in automatically
5. When the word is complete 🎉 → the next animal loads

Perfect for early readers and young kids.
